Q1:Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. Print out a message that tells how many years they have to be 100 years old.

Q2:Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user.

Q3:Take a list, say for example this one:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Q4:Take two lists, for example:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between them (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.

Q5:Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not.

q6:Letâ€™s say you are given a list saved in a variable:

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. 
Write a Dart code that takes this list and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.
