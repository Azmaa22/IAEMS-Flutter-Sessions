Q1: Take two lists, for example:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between them (without duplicates). 
Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes.



Q2: Letâ€™s say you are given a list saved in a variable:

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. 
Write a Dart code that takes this list and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.

Q3: Write a program that takes a list of numbers for example

a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.

Q4: Create a map with name, phone keys and store some values to it. Use where to find all keys that have length 4.

Q5: Create a set of fruits and print all fruits using loop.
